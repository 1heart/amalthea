% Function:    negativeLogLikelihood
% Description: Calculates the negative log likelihood of the currents set
%              samples using the given coefficients for WDE. (2D specific)
%
% Inputs:
%   samps             - Nx2 matrix of 2D samples to use for density 
%                       estimation.  The first column is x and second y.
%   wName             - name of wavelet to use for density approximation.
%                       Use matlab naming convention for wavelets.
%                       Default: 'db1' - Haar
%   startLevel        - starting level for the the father wavelet
%                       (i.e. scaling function).
%   stopLevel         - last level for mother wavelet scaling.  The start
%                       level is same as the father wavelet's.
%   coeffs            - Nx1 vector of coefficients for the basis functions.
%                       N depends on the number of levels and translations.
%   coeffsIdx         - Lx2 matrix containing the start and stop index
%                       locations of the coeffients for each level in the
%                       coefficient vector.  L is the number of levels.
%                       For example, the set of coefficients for the
%                       starting level can be obtained from the
%                       coefficients vector as:
%                       coeffs(coeffsIdx(1,1):coeffsIdx(1,2),1)
%                       NOTE: This will be (L+1)x2 whenever we use more
%                             than just scaling coefficients.
%   scalingOnly       - flag indicating if we only want to use scaling
%                       functions for the density estimation.
%   sampleSupport     - 2x2 matrix of the sample support.
%                       First row gives min x value and max x value
%                       Second row gives min y value and max y value
%
% Outputs:
%   currCost          - Negative log likelihood value over all samples.
%   currGrad          - Nx1 vector of gradient values for the log
%                       likelihood. N is the number of coefficients.
%   currHessian       - NxN Hessian matrix of the log likelihood.
