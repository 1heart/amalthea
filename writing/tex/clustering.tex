\part{Clustering on a Sphere}
In this investigation, we set out to test the Spherical K-means algorithm MATLAB implementation. To do this we had to understand the Von-Mises Fisher Distribution in order to create sample data on a sphere, as well as the K-means algorithm to further expand and visualize our understanding onto a higher, multidimensional space.
