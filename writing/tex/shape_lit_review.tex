\section{Previous work}

Shape analysis, classification, and retrieval has been developed quite extensively, especially in last decade, in part due to a rise in the number of available models and techniques to process them. In order to effectively exploit this rise in usable shapes, the development of a comparison and retrieval system is necessary, prominently in the 3D model search engine developed at Princeton\cite{funkhouser2003search}.

There is a broad swath of literature dedicated to 3D matching.
