\section{Von Mises distribution}

Intuitively, the Von Mises distribution \cite{wolfram_von_mises} is
a simple approximation for the normal distribution on a circle (known
as the \textit{wrapped normal distribution}). The Von Mises probability
density function is defined by the following equation:

\[
P(x)=\frac{{e^{b\cos(x-a)}}}{2\pi I_{0}(b)}
\]


where $I_{0}(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind;
the Von Mises cumulative density function has no closed form.

The mean $\mu=a$ (intuitively, the angle that the distribution clustered
around), and the circular variance $\sigma^{2}=1-\frac{{I_{1}(b)}}{I_{0}(b)}$
(intuitively, $b$ is the ``concentration'' parameter). Therefore,
as $b\rightarrow0$, the distribution becomes uniform; as $b\rightarrow\infty$,
the distribution becomes normal with $\sigma^{2}=1/b$.


\section{Von Mises-Fisher distribution}

The Von-Mises Fisher distribution is the generalization of the Von
Mises distribution to $n$-dimensional hyperspheres. It reduces to
the Von-Mises distribution with $n=2$. The probability density function
is defined by the following equation:

\[
f_{p}(\boldsymbol{x};\boldsymbol{\mu},\kappa)=C_{p}(\kappa)\exp(\kappa\boldsymbol{\mu}^{T}\boldsymbol{x})
\]


where

\[
C_{p}(\kappa)=\frac{\kappa^{p/2-1}}{(2\pi)^{p}I_{p/2-1}(\kappa)}
\]
 and intuitively is an approximation for the normal distribution on
the hypersphere.
